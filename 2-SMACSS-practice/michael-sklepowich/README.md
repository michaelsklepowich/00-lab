##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Anything that affected the background / text / higher level elements of the HTML I put in base.css
Anything that affected the structure of the elements compared to each other I put in layout.css
and anything that affected individual elements or colors went into modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I added comments to the CSS files so I could quickly match which CSS belonged to which element
